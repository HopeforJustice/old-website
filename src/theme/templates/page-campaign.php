            <strong>This year we are challenging everyone who wants to live in a world free from slavery to join the Hope Challenge 200 community and raise £200 for Hope for Justice. </strong> 
            <br><br>
            In our Hope Challenge 200 starter pack you will find seven challenges, each one different from the last, and all of them can be completed by an individual or a group. All you have to do is take a look and decide which one suits you, and your team (if you have one) best. 
            <br><br>
            But the challenge doesn’t stop there! While fundraising, you and your fellow challengers can earn extra awards for your efforts. You’ll be able to keep track of your progress, and see what awards your fellow challengers have won by receiving our monthly Hope Challenger participation board.

                    There are an estimated 130,000 people trapped in modern slavery in the UK alone, and an estimated 40.3 million worldwide. That’s the equivalent of over 60% of the UK population being treated as commodities. 
                    <br><br>
                    These numbers can seem overwhelming, and people often don’t know where to start to change them. But 2020 showed us the true power of coming together to fight injustice, even when physically apart.    
                    <br><br>
                    We wholeheartedly believe that 200 people coming together in a small way to stand up for what is right, is more powerful than one person going to extraordinary lengths by themselves. We believe that together we can end slavery.
                    <br><br>
                    All you have to do is join the Hope Challenge 200 community, and take on a challenge that could help to set each and every victim of slavery free.

                    <strong>Sports Day:</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Revel in some nostalgia, and get your heart pumping, by running a good old-fashioned school sports day.   
                    <br><br>
                    You could organise this with your friends and family in the back garden, ask your school to get involved, or get together with your gym buddies and make a day of it.    
                    <br><br>
                    To raise £200 all you would have to do is get 20 participants to donate £10 to take part. And why not ask participants’ families to sponsor you and raise even more?
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>take Hope Challenge 200 to the next level</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Want to get out and about? Take the Hope 200 Challenge to another level by walking 200,000 steps. You could take these steps across a few days, a week, or even a month. Just set yourself a goal, and ask your friends and family to sponsor you.    
                    <br><br>
                    To raise £200, you would need to raise 10p for every 1,000 steps you take. Easy!
